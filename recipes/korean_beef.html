            Serve over warm rice or spiralized vegetables. I don't 
            know, honestly I just grabbed this recipe off the 
            website because I can't cook lol. Yeah, sorry about
            the word plagiarism bro, I am just learning how to
            make websites.

            <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add beef and cook, stirring and crumbling into 
                small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Drain excess grease.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in garlic, ginger, and sesame oil and 
                cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir 
                in soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper. 
                Cook until beef absorbs some sauce, about 7
                 minutes. Add 1/2 of chopped green onions.
            </li>


            <li>

                sesame seeds and remaining green onions.
